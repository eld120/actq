## Accounteque Services Inc

The purpose of this project is to redesign/redeploy my father's business website as he currently does not have access to the current site that is live. The redesign will largely be a copy of the current site but with updates to improve the customer's user experience, mobile layout, and content edits for clarity/brevity.
